The project based on the esp 32 uses the "ESP32-2432S028R" board also known as "CYD".
Link to information about the board https://github.com/witnessmenow/ESP32-Cheap-Yellow-Display


Components :

esp32,

buzzer,

some buttons,

18650 li-ion battery,

powerbank PCB (any BMS),

Antena,

(The standard antenna covers a radius of 250 meters,
so I strongly recommend using an external one)


And of course some wires
